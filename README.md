#### Technical Requirements
The architecture must be split between a back-end and a web front-end, for instance, providing an in/out RESTful API in JSON. Feel free to use any other technologies, provided that the general client/service architecture is respected.

#### Functional Requirements
>1. Save, Update, and Delete items to/from a database of your choosing
>2. Authenticate users - allowing the same user to be signed in from multiple devices
>3. Allow add, edit, delete, “mark as purchased”, and “unmark as purchased” on each item
>4. Keep the list synced in real time from each device
>5. Accompany your code with a full test suite
>6. Deploy your site to a web host

#### Front-end
> We recommend using frameworks such as Rails, React or Angular, however, you're welcome to use any technology you're familiar with. Make sure to mention in your README how much experience you have with the framework you choose, which will be taken into account when reviewing your submission.
>##### Take this opportunity to demonstrate your CSS3 or HTML5 knowledge.

#### Back-end
>You are free to use any web framework. If you choose to use a framework that results in boilerplate code in the repository, please explain in your README which code was written by you (as opposed to generated code). 

>##### That said, here are some technologies we recommend: JavaScript/Node.js, Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
